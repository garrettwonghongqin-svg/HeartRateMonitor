# Heart Rate Monitor
This project works on a heart rate monitor using an arduino, a pulse sensor, a breadboard and an LCD display screen.
The codes are done in Arduino Idle, using C programming language.

Description:
When the user's heart pulse is less than 60 BPM, a "low heart rate" message is sent. 
When the user's heart pulse is more than 60 BPM but less than 100 bpm, a "normal heart rate" message is sent. 
When the user's heart pulse is more than 100 bpm, a "high heart rate" message is sent. 
These messages are displayed on an LCD display screen for users to read and understand their pulse rate.
